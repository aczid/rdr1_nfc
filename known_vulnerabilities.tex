\section{Security research}

While consumers might see NFC applications as a gadget that will make their lives easier, this development towards contactless payment systems has raised questions from security researchers.
%TODO Summarize and reference some security research done on RFID.

Because NFC will be used in payment and access control, it should be assumed that attackers will try to exploit this technology. Research has been done on the security of NFC and the results show that attacks are possible, which will be discussed below.

Because NFC will be used in payment and access control, it should be assumed that attackers will try to exploit this technology for their own gain. 
%Research has been done on the security of NFC in several areas, among which:

\subsection{Relay attacks}

RFID, a technology that NFC is compatible with, is prone to relay attacks. A relay attack is a combination of a man-in-the-middle and relay attack. The goal is that the attacker will gain something, but victim will lose something, e.g. the attackers will get an item from a shop, but the victim is the one who is paying. 
To achieve this, the attacker will need a device that fakes a NFC phone or plastic NFC card (ghost) and a device that fakes a reader (leech). The ghost will be used to communicate with a genuine reader and the leech will communicate with a genuine card. The attacker must trick the user into making a legitimate purchase, and have the devices set up in such a way that they operate on much larger distance then the normal operational distance of 10 cm, because then the attack will go unnoticed. \cite{1128470}
With this attack it will also be possible to gain access to the public transport. The check-in gate will communicate with the ghost, which will pass it on to the leech, which will pass it on victim and vice versa. The check-in gate will "think" it is communicating with the victim, but because the attacker is closer to the gate then the victim, he will gain access first and the victim will pay.

\subsection{Countermeasures relay attacks}
There are three possible countermeasures, a Fareday-cage, activation by the user or Two-Factor authentication. A Fareday-cage will block all the wireless communication, so an attacker can make contact with the device. This is not a feasible countermeasure for a mobile phone, because it will not have any connectivity.
With activation of the user, the user will have to switch on NFC on the device, to be able to e.g. make a payment or use public transport. It will not be possible for an attacker to use the phone at any time. This will slighty decrease the user friendliness, because the user will have to switch NFC on and off when it will be used.
With Two-Factor authentication, the user will be asked to present something, e.g. a password, pincode or token. NFC will be turned on all the time, but only when it will be used, the user will type the pincode and a connection is made. The attacker will actually notify the user, that a connection will be made. If the user is aware that the NFC connection is not necessary (because he is not near a payment terminal) and declines or does not type the pincode, the attack is avoided. This countermeassure will also decrease the user friendliness. \cite{1128470}

Overall this attack will not be feasible, because the attacker has to be in relative close range, which will look suspicious. It will also be difficult to maintain an active connection with the terminal and the victim.

\subsection{Malware distribution vectors}
One way to distribute malware is to use the smart poster. With a modified NFC-tag is has been proven to mislead a user to a malicious website. By using space, tab and new line characters in the NFC-tag, the attacker is able to modify the title of the message so that it looks normal (with a title and URL) to the user. The actual URL part of message is not shown to user, but it is still executed. The user is unaware, that he is directed to a malicious website, from there a number of attacks are possible. In the same way it is possible to let the user call or sent a text-message to a different number, e.g. an 0900-number.

It is also possible to hide and spread a worm in this manner. Therefore, the phone of the user has to be infected with the worm. When the phone reads a tag, it will try to change it, like discribed above. The next user will be pointed to a website where he will be tricked into downloading and installing a copy of the worm.

A denial of service attack is also possible, with the goal to let users stop using the service. By using a tag that sends out malformed messages, taped on top of the original tag, the phone of the user will crash when he attempts to read the tag. \cite{10.1109/ARES.2009.46}

\subsection{Differential Power Analysis Attack}

A Differential Power Analysis (DPA) attack is a form of side channel attack. A side channel attack is based on information that can be collected by analysing the physical implementation of a cryptographical system e.g. power usage, electromagnetic leakage or timing. With DPA the power consumption is measured to extract information about the workings of the crypto system.
