\abstract{

Near Field Communication is a relatively new technology, which might have a big impact on the way we pay and gain access to buildings, computersystems or even public transport. Because of these applications and the number of people that will be using it, it is necessary to research how secure NFC really is.  In this literature study we will look at the security architecture of NFC applications for mobile devices and what are some of the known and forseen vulnerabilities.

}

\section{Problem}

These days most people have at least two things in their pocket, a mobile device (this can be a mobile phone, PDA or nowadays a combination of those two, called a smartphone) and a wallet. In the wallet there is a certain amount of money, either in the form of cash or bankcard, or both. And with this everything is payed, from small micropayments (candy from a machine) to big purchases in a shop.
\\ Recently a few pilots have been started \cite{payter} to combine the wallet and the mobile device into one thing. This is done by taking a mobile device and adding a NFC implementation. NFC stands for Near Field Communication, which allows a device to communicate wirelessly which another device. A result of this will be several implementations, for example one implementation will allow people to pay with their mobile device and an other will use tickets for public transport and events. 
\\ While these applications will bring a lot of possibillities, it will also introduce security risks. For example, as mentioned before the communication between the mobile device and a paymentsystem will be wireless. As with any wireless communication, it is possible to capture this traffic, if you have the right equipment. Another interesting aspect, is that a mobile device is in hands of a user, who might start tempering the hardware. It is still unknown to us what these vulnerabilities are and if there are some countermeassures present to prevent them. Therefore we will focus, we will focus on the known and foreseen vulnerabilities of NFC, by answering the research question below.

\subsection{Research question}

At the end of our research we will try to answer to following research question. 
\\

\noindent What is the security architecture of NFC applications for mobile devices and what are some of the known and forseen vulnerabilities? % Moet nog aangepast

\noindent We are able to give the following hypothesis:
\\

\noindent We think that the most vulnerabilities will be found in the transmission of wireless data and the implementation of secure elements. % Even geen idee hoe ik hier verder kan

\subsubsection{Sub-questions}

In order to answer the main research question, we'll answer the following sub-questions.

\begin{itemize}
\item [-] What is the architecture of NFC-enabled mobile device?

\item [-] What are some of the known vulnerabilities in NFC or NFC-like applications?

\item [-] Based on the architecture and known vulnerabilities, what will the forseen vulnerabilities be?

\item [-] How do these vulnerabilities work?

\item [-] What might be possible countermeassures against these vulnerabilities?

\end{itemize}

\section{Scope}
We are aware that because of the time restrictions in place, we won't be able to cover the entire breadth and depth of NFC systems.
In some implementations of an NFC system, a back-end is used to handle transactions.
Because the back-end is likely to be different for each implementation, we will scope our research down to the technical details of a generalized NFC interaction.
We will provide an up-to-date introduction on the architecture of an NFC-enabled mobile device, focusing mainly on security-related components.
Using this work as a guideline we will document some known vulnerabilities in NFC applications, examining their technical details.
We will document known countermeasures for any vulnerabilities that we become aware of.
If time permits, we hope to illustrate these vulnerabilities by including a case study.

\section{Motivation}

With the current technology it is possible to make everyday jobs or actions easier and more comfortable.
It is now possible to take your phone with you, instead of calling from a house, as was the case a few years ago.
Instead of paying with coins and bills, we now pay using a bankcard.
But in this century, the evolution of technology does not stop, so ideas like paying with your phone comes to mind.
These days the development timeframe is so short, some details are possibly overlooked.
For systems dealing with security, these oversights can be devastating.
%In IT this is mostly security related. 
\\

\noindent In our opnion security issues should be addressed in any IT project. Especially when the system will be open to the public and a lot of people will depend on it.
When NFC-enabled devices take off and people start using NFC-based applications, it will be too late to makes significant changes that will improve security.
Therefore we think it's very important to research and document the known security issues regarding NFC-enabled devices.

\section{Strategy}
In our study we want to investigate the architecture of NFC-enabled devices with a focus on the technical details of the security model.
We first hope to reach a general, high-level understanding of the system's capabilities and uses, and write a solid introduction before delving into the more technical details.
%We hope to present a clear introduction on the state of NFC systems, citing some notable deployments and prospective uses.
%After this groundwork, we will focus on the technical details of the NFC-enabled devices highlighting some of the security vulnerabilities and risks involved.
We will do this by summarizing existing work (such as \cite{Paus2007}, \cite{1731794} and others) on the general workings of NFC systems.

After this high-level introduction which illustrates the context of our research we will limit our scope to the NFC devices themselves and will document the architecture of the security mechanisms in place.
There is plenty of literature (such as \cite{mulliner09:vulnanamms}, \cite{Kfir05pickingvirtual} and others) to guide us in researching the security aspects of NFC systems. 
We hope to be able to point out some known or possible vulnerabilities in these.
We would like to also include a case study of an NFC system implementation.
This could be entirely theoretical but if time permits, would warrant some practical experimentation.
