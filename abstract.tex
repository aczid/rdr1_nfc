\begin{abstract}
An emerging technology known as Near Field Communication will allow mobile devices like smartphones to take on the functionality of RFID cards and their current roles, including payment and access control.
The design of the security architecture of NFC-based applications has to take into account the hostile environment a modern mobile phone can be exposed to, which sparked our interest in its design.
Mobile devices could become a be viable target for criminal hackers, as they are exposed to the outside world through an expanding set of features and run more and more software packages.
Reviewing the literature, we can conclude that while NFC applications can be implemented in a secure manner, the deployment in mobile devices provides risks and limitations hindering its adoption.
