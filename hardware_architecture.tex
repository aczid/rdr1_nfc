\section{Secure elements}
In "Promising secure element alternatives for NFC technology" four different secure elements are proposed, of which one is suggested as the most likely candidate to be used.
The secure element to be used is a \textit{Universal Integrated Circuit Card} (UICC), this is a smartcard which is used in a mobile phone to connect to the GSM and UTMS network. % UICC toevoegen aan glossary
UICC is suggested because it's secured, already in use and thus tried, removable and standardized, which means a user can switch phones. 

\section{Standardization}
NFC has been described by NFCIP-1 (Near Field Communication Interface Protocol 1) first on ISO18092, ECMA340 and ETSI TS102 and also NFCIP-2 defined in ISO 21481, ECMA352 and ETSI TS102 312.
With NFCIP-2, NFC became compliant with the RFID standards of ISO14443 and ISO15693.
