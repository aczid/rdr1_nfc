\abstract{

Finding bugs in large pieces of software is traditionally done by testing a finite set of input data. This is both time-consuming and inaccurate, because not all execution paths can be tested in a reasonable amount of time. A recent development is the application of formal methods while developing software to reduce the amount of bugs introduced to the software. ESC/Java2 is one of these applications; it is a tool that preforms formal static verification of Java code annotated with JML. This literary study into ESC/Java2 will look at how successful the application of ESC/Java2 is in the verification of Java source code by looking at several case studies and properties of ESC/Java2.

\section{Problem}

These days most people have at least two things in their pocket, a mobile device (this can be a mobile phone, PDA or now a days a combination of those two, called a smartphone) and a wallet. In the wallet there is a certain amount of money, either in the form of cash or bankcard, or both. And with this everything is payed, from small micropayments (candy from a machine) to big purchases in a shop.
\\ Recently a few pilots have been started \textbf { [bron noemen]} to combine the wallet and the mobile device into one thing. This is done by taking a mobile device and adding a NFC implementation. NFC stands for Near Field Communication, which allows a device to communicate wirelessly which an other device. A result of this will be several implementations, for example one implementation will allow people to pay with their mobile device and an other will use tickets for publictransport and events. 
\\ While these applications will bring a lot of possibillities, it will also introduce security risks. In our paper we will focus on the known and forseen vulnerabilities of NFC.
