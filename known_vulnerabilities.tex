\section{Known Vulnerabilities}

While consumers might see NFC applications as a gadget that will make their lives easier, this development towards contactless payment systems rightfully raises questions from a security perspective.
%TODO Summarize and reference some security research done on RFID.
Because NFC will be used in payment and access control, it should be assumed that attackers will try to exploit this technology. Research has been done on the security of NFC and the results show that attacks are possible, which will be discussed below.

\subsection{Relay attacks}

RFID, a technology that NFC is compatible with, is prone to relay attacks. A relay attack is a combination of a man-in-the-middle and relay attack. The goal is that the attacker will gain something, but victim will lose something, e.g. the attackers will get an item from a shop, but the victim is the one who is paying. 
To achieve this, the attacker will need a device that fakes a NFC phone or plastic NFC card (ghost) and a device that fakes a reader (leech). The ghost will be used to communicate with a genuine reader and the leech will communicate with a genuine card. The attacker must trick the user into making a legitimate purchase, and have the devices set up in such a way that they operate on much larger distance then the normal operational distance of 10 cm, because then the attack will go unnoticed. \cite{1128470}
This attack will also be possible to gain access to public transport. The check-in gate will communicate with the ghost, which will pass it on to the leech, which will pass it on victim and vice versa. The check-in gate will "think" it is communicating with the victim, but because the attacker is much closer to the gate then the victim, he will gain access first.

\subsection{Malware distribution vectors}
In \cite{10.1109/ARES.2009.46} a few attacks with Smart Posters are explained.

Here the information in NFC-tag will direct the mobile device to a malicious site where the user is tricked into making, for example a financial transaction.
